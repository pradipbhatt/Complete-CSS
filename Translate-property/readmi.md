**The translate property allows you to change the position of elements. The translate property defines x- and y-coordinates of an element in 2D. 
<br>
You can also define the z-coordinate to change position in 3D. Coordinates can be given as only x-coordinates, x- and y-coordinates, or x-, y- and z-coordinates.

<br>
translate(x, y): It specifies a translation across the X and Y axes.
translate3d(x, y, z): It specifies a translation across the X, Y, and Z axes.
translateX(x): It specifies the translation across the X-axis only.
translateY(y): It specifies the translation across the Y-axis only.
translateZ(z): It specifies the translation across the Z-axis only.
